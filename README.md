# Mobile Flashcards App

Create your own flashcard decks so you can study and quiz yourself to remember what you need to! This application uses React Native (supplemented with Expo) to manage the UI, and Async Storage/Redux for state management.

## Getting Started

To use this application locally, you must install Node.js, Node Package Manager (npm), and Expo. For the best user experience, download the Expo Client app from the iOS App Store/Android Play Store. (Expo is used to serve the native application to the web and/or Expo Client app).

### Installation

1. clone/fork this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jeffn12/reactnd-flashcards.git`
1. install app dependencies: `npm install`
1. run the app: `npm run start` - runs a server accessible from any platform (web, iOS, Android)
   (`npm run android`, `npm run ios`, `npm run web` - may also be used to run the server for a specific platform)
